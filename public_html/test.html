    <p>Hello mate. I'm Jo√£o Pedro, a 20-year-old Brazilian boy. Currently trying to get my graduate degree in computer science from the Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, but at the same time spending too much time creating scripts to everything. 
        I have some experience with Java, JavaScript, Python, and Shell Script.
        In my spare time, I like to listen to podcasts, to music, watch movies and sleep :D</p>
